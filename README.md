# AnalysisWork

Contained here are demonstrations, examples, and prototypes 
for various activities that I've been involved in.
See the (wiki)[Analysis-work] pages for more details.

## lariat

Extracting data from LArIAT / LArSoft to use for display using ParaView.  
It includes the work to activiate Geant4 visualization to dump out the 
geometry description of the detector.

## study

A prototype "make study" area for developing and building art modules
and utilities outside the context of an experiment or project's 
official repository structure and UPS / MRB build and development 
structure.  It basically latches on to an existing product release
and uses cetbuildtools / cmake to build libraries and 
executables.

## examples

I've started to put example code here that I've sent to people for
demonstrating certain features of C++ or libraries that we want
to use.
